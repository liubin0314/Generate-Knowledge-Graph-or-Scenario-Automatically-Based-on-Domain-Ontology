# Generate-Scenario-Automatically-Based-on-Domain-Ontology
A small tool for automatically generating scenarios. This tool can automatically generate instantiated scenarios that conforms to the specifications in the predefined domain ontology. The free version supports single thread and single small scenario (within 50 instances, relationship between 200 instances).
There are 3 examples in the source code: time, family and network. Based on the time, family and network ontologies, 3 scenarios are generated, shown in the figures below.

The randomly generated family scenario which is consistent with the ontology of family.

The randomly generated network which conforms the norms in the network ontology. The generated network composes of terminals (laptops, phones, printers and etc.),  servers, routers, switchs and firewalls.

The randomly generated time (time interals and time instants) scenario which is consistent with the ontology of time.
